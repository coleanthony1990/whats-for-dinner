## Introduction

This application allows the user to pick a side dish, main, dessert, or all 3 to produce a random dish or entire meal. Made by me: ([Cole Anthony](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cole-edwin-anthony/)) The application can be accessed [here]([https://coleanthony1990.github.io/tic-tac-toe/](https://coleanthony1990.github.io/whats-for-dinner/))

## Using the app
Users can use this app by choosing 1 of 4 options from the square on the left side. When the user clicks "Submit" after they have selected their option, they will be presented with a random dish or 3 dishes(if they chose "entire meal") in the box on the right side.
## Screen Shots

## Future Additions
I would like to make the 'clear' button work properly and add more to the options for meals.
## Reflections
The CSS was the most challenging as there is a lot to learn about it. The 'clear' button was also difficult but I believe I know how to do it now and will add it.
